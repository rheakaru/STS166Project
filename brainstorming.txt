From the syllabus: "We will focus mainly on knowledge and information infrastructures: libraries, classification systems, scientific research practices, the Internet, the World Wide Web, and cyberinfrastructures in the physical and social sciences. Infrastructures are ecologies of numerous systems, each with unique origins and goals, which are made to interoperate by means of standards, socket layers, social practices, norms, and individual behaviors that smooth out the connections among them."

Ideas:  
Code, standard libraries
Git systems
Open sourced code
	The infrastructure for sharing code (github)
	The infrastructure for collaborating
		Stack overflow
		Libraries
	The norms that make it possible
		Coding practises
		Community factors — trust
		The general acceptance — copyright stuff, compensation
	The dangers of the system
		Viruses that exploit the open source code
			What are the vetting practises
Coding community — social norms and how that affects coding habits
Tab vs space
lowerCamelCase
decomp/commenting
The culture of computing makes code more reuseable 
	Ideals hidden in that 

Different systems: 
	Graphics
	User interface
	Database
	Software stuff
