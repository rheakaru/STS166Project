  Open Source and Developers
  OSS projects are collaboration opportunities that improve skills and build connections in the field. Developers must be proficient with standard tools of open-source development.
  Communication tools - Email, real-time messaging, forums, and wikis help developers to find solutions or bounce ideas off each other.
  Distributed revision control systems - When multiple developers in different geographical locations modify data and files, these systems manage the different versions and updates.
  Bug trackers and task lists - Allow large-scale projects to monitor issues and keep track of their fixes.
  Testing and debugging tools - Automate testing during system integration and debug other programs.

  Open source.com:
  The term "open source" refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.
  The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs. 
  Today, however, "open source" designates a broader set of valuesâ€”what we call "the open source way." 
  Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, 
  collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.
